        <p >Anne Eberhard</p>
        <h2 >Your data subject rights</h2>
        <p >
          You can exercise the following rights at any time using the contact details
          provided for our data protection officer:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li >
            Information about your data stored by us and its processing (Art. 15
            DSGVO),
          </li>
          <li >Correction of incorrect personal data (Art. 16 DSGVO)</li>
          <li >Deletion of your data stored by us (Art. 17 DSGVO),</li>
          <li >

          </li>
          <li >
            objection to the processing of your data by us (Art. 21 DSGVO) and

          </li>
        </ul>
      
        <p >
          If you have given us consent, you can revoke this at any time with effect
          for the future. You may at any time lodge a complaint with a supervisory
          authority, e.g. the competent supervisory authority in the federal state of
          your residence or the authority responsible for us as the responsible body.
          A list of supervisory authorities (for the non-public sector) with address
          can be found at:

        <h2 >Collection of general information when visiting our website</h2>
        <h2 >Nature and purpose of processing:</h2>
        <p >
          When you access our website, i.e., when you do not register or otherwise
          submit information, information of a general nature is automatically
          collected. This information (server log files) includes, for example, the
          type of web browser, the operating system used, the domain name of your
          Internet service provider, your IP address and the like.
        </p>
        <p >In particular, they are processed for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li >ensuring a smooth connection setup of the website,</li>
          <li >ensuring a smooth use of our website,</li>
          <li >evaluating system security and stability, and</li>
          <li >to optimize our website.</li>
        </ul>
        <p >
          We do not use your data to draw conclusions about your person. Information
          of this kind will be statistically evaluated anonymously by us, if
          necessary, in order to optimize our Internet presence and the technology
          behind it.
        </p>
        <h2 >Legal basis and legitimate interest:</h2>
        <p >
          The processing is carried out in accordance with Art. 6 (1) lit. f DSGVO on
          the basis of our legitimate interest in improving the stability and
          functionality of our website.
        </p>
        <h2 >Recipients:</h2>
        <p >
          Recipients of the data may be technical service providers who act as order
          processors for the operation and maintenance of our website.
        </p>
        <h2 >Storage period:</h2>
        <p >
          The data is deleted as soon as it is no longer required for the purpose for
          which it was collected. This is generally the case for data used to provide
          the website when the respective session has ended.
        </p>
        <h2 >Provision mandatory or required:</h2>
        <p >
          The provision of the aforementioned personal data is not required by law or
          contract. However, without the IP address, the service and functionality of
          our website is not guaranteed. In addition, individual services and services
          may not be available or may be limited. For this reason, an objection is
          excluded.
        </p>
        <h2 >Contact form</h2>
        <h2 >Nature and purpose of processing:</h2>
        <p >
          The data you enter will be stored for the purpose of individual
          communication with you. For this purpose, it is necessary to provide a valid
          e-mail address and your name. This serves the assignment of the request and
          the subsequent response to the same. The provision of further data is
          optional.
        </p>
        <h2 >Legal basis:</h2>
        <p >
          The processing of the data entered in the contact form is based on a
          legitimate interest (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO). By providing the contact
          form, we would like to enable you to contact us in an uncomplicated manner.
          The information you provide will be stored for the purpose of processing the
          request and for possible follow-up questions. If you contact us to request a
          quote, the data entered in the contact form will be processed to carry out
          pre-contractual measures (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b DSGVO).
        </p>
        <h2 >Recipients:</h2>
        <p >Recipients of the data are order processors, if applicable.</p>
        <h2 >Storage period:</h2>
        <p >
          Data will be deleted no later than 6 months after the request has been
          processed. If a contractual relationship arises, we are subject to the
          statutory retention periods under the German Commercial Code (HGB) and will
          delete your data after these periods have expired.
        </p>
        <h2 >Provision mandatory or required:</h2>
        <p >
          The provision of your personal data is voluntary. However, we can only
          process your request if you provide us with your name, e-mail address and
          the reason for the request.
        </p>
        <h2 >Withdrawal of consent:</h2>
        <p >
          No option for a simple opt-out or blocking of data transmission is currently
          offered by the provider. If you wish to prevent tracking of your activities
          on our website, please revoke your consent for the corresponding cookie
          category or all technically unnecessary cookies and data transfers in the
          cookie consent tool. In this case, however, you may not be able to use our
          website or may only be able to use it to a limited extent.
        </p>
        <h2 >Revocation of consent:</h2>
        <p >
          No option for a simple opt-out or blocking of data transmission is currently
          offered by the provider. If you wish to prevent tracking of your activities
          on our website, please revoke your consent for the relevant cookie category
          or all technically unnecessary cookies and data transfers in the cookie
          consent tool. In this case, however, you may not be able to use our website
          or may only be able to use it to a limited extent.
        </p>
        <h2 >SSL encryption</h2>
        <p >
          To protect the security of your data during transmission, we use state of
          the art encryption (e.g. SSL) via HTTPS.
        </p>
        <h2 >
          Information about your right to object according to Art. 21 DSGVO
        </h2>
        <h2 >Individual right of objection</h2>
        <p >
          You have the right to object at any time, on grounds relating to your
          particular situation, to the processing of personal data relating to you
          which is carried out on the basis of Art. 6(1)(f) DSGVO (data processing on
          the basis of a balance of interests); this also applies to profiling based
          on this provision within the meaning of Art. 4 No. 4 DSGVO. If you object,
          we will no longer process your personal data unless we can demonstrate
          compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your
          interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing serves the purpose of
          asserting, exercising or defending legal claims.
        </p>

          changes to our services in the data protection declaration, e.g. when
          introducing new services. The new data protection statement will then apply
          to your next visit.
